# ClimbeyMod
A mod for the demo version of Climbey on Oculus Quest that lets you play custom levels.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
1. Install the Climbey demo from Sidequest. <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/app/331/climbey-demo">Link</a> <br/>
2. Download the Android MelonLoader apk and install through Sidequest or adb. <a href="https://github.com/SirCoolness/MelonLoader/releases/">Link</a><br/>
3. Open the MelonLoader apk on your headset and patch the Climbey demo. It will ask you to give the app permission to install apps for you. Allow it and go back. You may have to restart the MelonLoader patch process.<br/>
4. Once the patched version of Climbey is installed, open the app, wait a few seconds, then close it. This will generate the necessary files in your Android data path.<br/>
5. On sidequest, go to the folder on your headset at Android/data/net.shadowbraingames.climbeydemo/files/Mods<br/>
6. Place the dll from the <a href="https://github.com/Waterdish/ClimbeyMod/releases/tag/Releases">Releases page</a> in the Mods folder.<br/>
7. Load up the Climbey Demo on your headset. This will take a while the very first time where you're just sitting at a black screen. It's loading things so don't close the app. It will not take this long after the first time.<br/>
8. Play your custom levels.<br/>

<h2>Help</h2>
1. There are three buttons when you open the menu. Built-In, Custom, and Random. Built-In plays the campaign levels, Custom will play the levels in your levels folder in order, and random will download a random level from the internet and save it to your levels folder.<br/><br/>
2. The custom levels are saved to Android/data/net.shadowbraingames.climbeydemo/files/levels. You can manually bring your levels from PC to this folder and it will detect them if you select the "Custom" playlist in the menu.<br/><br/>
3. On occasion, the random button fails to download a level. If this happens just try again. This shouldn't happen too often.<br/>
